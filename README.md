The website is responsive, and the layout will ensure that visitors can easily navigate through web

It will use a modern clean sans-serif font such as Roboto or Open Sans for headings, body texts and 
paragraphs to improve readability and give a professional look. The website will use a colour palette 
that is cloud-inspired with blue, white and a shade of black to represent trust, reliability and

For the front-end we will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and interactive user 
webpages (MDN Web Docs, 2023).  
The back-end will use PHP, which is mostly used for handling server-side logic and database 
communication (Flanagan, 2020).  
A MySQL database system will be implemented to support structured data management depending 
on the needs of the business (Chodorow, 2013).
